VPN Notes (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDC593HsD8o&list=PLNiDDlsOrmMuoN8-FwPHwxfNsy33hmbg7&index=36)

1. Layer 2 VPNs
	Ethernet VLANs and QinQ
	Frame Relay & ATM PVCs	
	VPLS
2. Layer 3 VPNs
	GRE Tunnel
	MPLS Tunnel
	IPSec Tunnel
Why use IPSec VPN?
	Does not need static SP provisioning.
	Independent of SDP access.
	IPv4/IPv6 transport only needed.
	Allows both site-to-site and remote access VPNs.
	
IPSec is a security suite ...
	Data origin authentication
	Data Integrity 
	Data Confidentiality
	Anti-replay( Not repeated transmission is allowed.)
It works on Layer 3
	Different from SSL (7) or 802.1AE(2)
	Encrypts and authenticates IP Packets
	Uses symmetric ciphers for encryption(e.g. 3DES)
	Keyed hashing for authentication of data (MD5).

Used to create P2P associations between tunnel endpoints.

IPSec tunnels are dynamically negotiated with IKEv1/IKEv2.
	-Main goal is to not have to define crypto keys manually.

IPSec uses two data structures to build a tunnel 
	-Security Association (SA)
	  An agreement of IKE/IPSec Parameters
	  Maintains encryption and authentication keys.
	-Security Parameter Index (SPI)
	  Field in packet headr to select SA on receiver.
	  Similar to VLAN header or MPLS label .

ISAKMP & IKEv1

Negotiation protocols used from SAs
	Uses bidirectional UDP port 500 connection for transport.
Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP)
	-ISAKMP is the framework	
	-Says that authentication and keying should occur
Internet Key Exchange (IKEv1)
	-IKE is th eactual implementation 
	-Defines how auth and keying occurs.

IPSec Tunnel Negotiation 
	Goal of IPSec exchange is to establish SAs
	Occurs through two main negotiation phases using IKE1.

	IPSec Phase 1 
	Main goal is to authenticate the endpoints and build a secure tunnel for phase 2 exchange.
	Uses ISAKMP and IKEv1 protocols to establish ISAKMP SA.
	ISAKMP SA creates path for further negotiations.

	IPSec Phase 2
	Main goal is to establish the encrypted tunnel used to protect the actual user traffic .
	Creates the IPSec SA used to transport protected traffic.


ISAKMP/IKEv1 Workflow-
	-Occurs in Phase 1 negotiation
	-Result is the ISAKMP SA
	Performs additional negotiations 
	-Occurs in Phase 1.5 negotiation
	-Extended Authentication (Xauth)
	-Mode COnfiguration(Mode-Cfg)
	Negotiate data protection parameters
	-Occurs inphase 2 negotiation
	-Result is the IPsec SA
Negotiating ISAKMP SA
	During IKEv1 Phase 1 peers exchange and agree upon parameters such as 
	-Authentication method
		.PSK/RSA-Sig/RSA-Enc
	-Encryption Type
		.DES/3DES/AES
	-Hash Algorithm 
		.MD5/SHA1
	-Deffie-Hellman group 
		.1,2,5...
ISAKMP Aythentication
	-In IKEv1 authentication first performed to verify party identities
	-In IKEv2 authentication is done after SA etablished 
	IKEv1 Authentication via
	-Pre-Shared Keys (PSK)
		.Host knows same key via out of band exchange 
	-RSA Signature 
		.Host trust certificate authority for authentication
	-RSA encrypted nonces

#Combination of these ISAKMP parameters makes up the ISAKMP Policy
	-IKE initiator sends all its policies through a proposal
	-IKE responder checks received policies against its own
		.First match is used 
		.Else connection is rejected.
IPSec Phase 1

IKEv1 Negotiation Mode
	Two IKEv1 modes define howe proposal process occurs
	-Main Mode
		.Uses six messages for negotiation
		.Takes longer time to negotiate but hides party identities by performing DH exchange first.
	-Aggressive Mode 
		.Uses three messages for negotiation
		.Takes less time to negotiate but does not hide party identities.
		.Permits for flexible authentication eith pre-shared keys.
			Ex-- Easy VPN



IKEv1 Main Mode Message Flows 

	1. Message1: Initiator -> Responder 
	-Proposals for ISAKMP SA ( cipher/hash/DH group)
	2.Message 2: Responder -> Initiator
	-Selected ISAKMP proposal (cipher/hash/DH group)
	3. Message 3: Initiator -> Responder 
	-Deffie-HellmanKey-Exchange(KEX) message:based on negotiated DH group
	4. Responder->Initiator
	-Deffie-Hellman Key-Exchange (KEX) response : ISAKMP SA Created
	5. Message 5: Initiator -> Responder 
	-Initiator Identity Payload (e.e hostname, FQDN,etc)
	6. Message6: Responder -> Initiator
	-Receiver identity Payload : Authentication COmpleted.

IKEv1 Aggressive Mode Message Flow-
	1. Message 1: Initiator-> Responder 
	-Proposals for ISAKMP SA(cipher/hash/DH group)+ Initiator Identity
	2. Message 2: Responder -> Initiator 
	-Selected ISAKMP Proposals + DH KEX +Responder Identity ( no ISAKMP SA yet)
	3. Message 3: Initiator -> Responder 	
	-DH KEX + Responder Identity : ISAKMP SA now formed , authentication completed.


Negotiating IPSec SA (Phase 2)
	-During Phase 2 peers exchange and agree upon parameters such as 
		. Encapsulation protocol , encryption and authentication methods 
			.ESPvs AH		
			.MD5(128bits) SHA(160bits) SHA256 SHA384 SHA512
			.DESvs3DESvsaAES/AES-GCM/AES-GMAC(128bit,192bit,256bits)
			.Tunnel vs Transport Mode
	-Proxy Identities
		.Defines what traffic will be protected
		.Also called as Proxy ACls
	-SA Lifetime
Phase 2 Message Flow 

	Quick Mode 
	-Phase 2 for IPSec SA uses Quick Mode
	-Peers were already authenticated in phase 1 so only two messages are needed
		.Message 1: Initiator->Responder
			.SA Proposal 	, DH KEX message , Proxy IDs
		.Message 2: Responder -> Initiator
			.Selected SA ,DH Kex message , Proxy IDs

IPSec supports two protocols for encapsulations of traffic 
	-Authentication Header (AH)
	-Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP)
	-Security Protocols is negotiated during Phase 2 , called the IPSec Transform set

AH vs ESP 

	AH IP Protocol number is 51 
	AH , data origin authentication includes IP Header 
	AH, data integrity
	Ah, only supports authentication not encryption (rarely used with VPNs)

	ESP IP protocol number is 50
	ESP , Dat origin authentication excludes IP Header 
	ESP , Data integrity
	ESP, Data encryption 
	ESP, Anti replay

SA Refreshing 
	-ISAKMP /IPSec SA have finite lifetimes 
	-Before expiration SA is re-keyed
	-Lifetime can be in time or bits
	-Lower value of initiator or receiver is negotiated.

PFS ( Perfect Forward Secrecy )
	-Can be negotiated during Quick Mode IPSec SA
	-Casues new DH exchange prior to rekeying (refreshing) IPSec SA
	-Makes IPSec SA keys completely independent from previous ones
	-More secure but more CPU overhead.

IPSec Control vs Data Plane
	IPSec Control Plane (ISAKMP)
	-UDP 500 (default if no NAT device)
	-UDP 4500 (default if NAT device)
	-TCP custome port (only if gateway is ASA)
		IKEv1 Payload inside TCP 
	IPSec Data Plane 
	-ESP or AH ( default if no NAT Device in path )
	-ESP over UDP 4500 (default if NAT device is in path )
	-ESP over UDP custom port (only if gateway is ASA)
	-ESP over TCP custom port (only if gateway is ASA)
	-AH is not NAT friendly since it authenticates IP header

NAT-T and Transport Tunneling 

	-NAT-T or transport tunneling support negotiated in fist two IKEv1 messages
	-needs to be supported by both the peers.
	-NAT-T requirements detected in IKEv1 messages 3 and 4
	-If NAT-T required IKEv1 messages 5 and 6 change to UDP 4500
	-If NAT-T required , Phase 2 change ti UDP 4500
	-UDP destination port is always 4500
	-UDP original source port is 4500 but changed by PAT device.
	-NAT_T and transparent tunneling aren't the same thing.

Tunnel vs Transport 
	-AH & ESP support two mode encapsulation.
	-Transport 
		Original IP Header retained 
		Payload and layer 4 header authenticated and encrypted.
		Complete packet authenticated with AH 
		Typically used in host to IPSec
	-Tunnel 
		Adds new IP Header 
		Original header & payload authenticated/encrypted with ESP.
		Complete packet authenticated with AH 
		Typically used between IPSec gateways or host to IPSec gateways.


IOS LAN to LAN IPSec Configuration 	:-

CryptoMap
	-Legacy method of IOS IPSec Configuration 	
		.Still required on ASA Firewall
	-Used to form on-demand IPSec Tunnels
		.Session initiated only when interesting traffic detected.
	-No dynamic routing support through tunnel
		.Exception on ASA , allowed via OSPF
CryptoMap Working
	Crypto map is data plane filter	
		.Matching traffic triggers ISAKMP session
		.Traffic matched using ACLs
		.ACLs define Proxy IDs for IPSec Phase2 
		.Crypto map apply to physical (sub) interfaces
		.Only one crypto map per interface 
		.Always outbound with respect to traffic direction
		.Processed top down until ACL match occurs
		.By default interface IP used for ISAKMP tunnel source
		.Can be changed using #crypto-map local-address

Crypto-Maps Order of Operations 	
	-Encryption applies after routing
	-Static routing may be required 
	-Encryption applies after NAT
	-NAT exemption may be required 
	-Rule of thumb is that crypto , routing and NAT processess are always independent of each other.

Configuration Steps :-
Define IKEv1 Phase 1 IPSec Policy 
	-Authentication 
	-Encryption
	-Hash
	-DH Group 
	-Lifetime (Lower value is negotiated)
	-Like a route -map processesd top down until a match occurs by the responder.
	-Based on Policy priority
	-Lower priority value has higher precedence

Define IKEv2 Phase 2 Policy IPSec
	-Define peer address , hostname
	-Define proxy ACL
	-Define transform set
	-Only tunnel mode supported unless gateway IPs are included in crypto-ACL
	-Configuration applied with crypto-map
	-On interface closest to the destination
	-Multiple routes means multiple interfaces

Default Phase 1 and Phase 2 Policies 

	-IOS includes default fallback policies for both Phase 1 ISAKMP and Phase 2 IPSec
	-There are eight default iSAKMP policies available
	-Active untill user-configurable policies are created
	-Active unless disabled with #no crypto isakmp default policy
	-There are two default transform-set available 
	-Active for all crypto-maps IPSec profiles if user-configured set is not applied 
	-Active unless disabled with #no crypto ipsec transform-set default
