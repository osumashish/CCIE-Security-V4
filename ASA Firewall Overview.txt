For ASA Firewall - copy disk0:/coredumpinfo/coredump.cfg use_ttyS0

ASA Security Levels:- 
	-ASA classifies the level of "trust" of an interface by it's security level ranging from 0-100.
	-Where 0 will be least trusted and 100 will be most trusted.
	-0 is assigned ot all th einterfaces by default.
	-ASA interfaces can only pass traffice if both "nameif" and "security-level" is defined.
	-Traffic from higher to lower security level permitted by default.
	   E.g - Inside to Outside
	-Traffic from lower to higher security level is denied by default.
		E.g Outside to Inside
	-Traffic between same level of security or interfaces with same security level will be denied by default.
	-Exception with #same-security-traffic permit inter-interface
	-#same-security-traffic permit intra-interface (Hairpining)
	-Security levels can be bypassed by inbound or global ACLs.
	
ASA Stateful Firewall FIltering 
	-Enabled by default for TCP/UDP traffic and cannot be disabled .
	-Track traffic that moves from trusted n/w to the untrusted n/w.
	-Create an entry in the state table for traffic flow.
	-Track traffic that tries to enter from the untrusted network to the trusted network.
	-If there is an entry in the state table permit it or else drop it.

ASA Traffic Inspection
	-Modular Policy Framework (MPF) used to control how traffic is inspected.
	-What traffic is inspected, basic layer 3& 4 inspection of TCP,UDP and ICMP.
	-Application aware inspection of HTTP,SMTP,DNS,SIP etc.
	-ACLs are used to exempt or include the traffic into MPF engine.

ASA Context MOdes:-
	-Single Context MOde
	-Multiple Context Mode(Virtual Firewall)
	-In single context mode, there will be shared config for all interfaces , security policies , routing table and administrators etc.
	-In multiple context mode , ther ewill a seperate parameters for all.
	-Allows for multiple virtual firewalls for managed services or policy seperation.

ASA Firewall Mode
	-Routed Firewall(By Default)
	-Transparent Firewall(VPN Termination not possible)
		.Interfaces can be in same subnet but in diffrent VLANs.
		.Traffic is bridged between interfaces.
		.Only one bridge group can be created between two interfaces before 8.4.
		.Up to 8 bridge with 4 interfaces per bridge-group starting with 8.4.


ASA Basic Initialization :- 
	
	-There are ways we can use to access the ASA firewall 
		.CLI base 
		.ASDM (Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager)
		.We can use ASDMA because there are certain tasks which can only be completed using the GUI like SSL VPN Bookmarks,AnyConnect Client Profilies etc.)

Commands used to initialize-
	#write erase or #clear startup-config
	#clear configure all (Does not prompt for confirmation)
	#show firewall
	#show mode
	#show run
	#show running-config all class-map
	#show running-config all policy-map
	#show running-config all group-policy
	#vpnsetup 
	#vpnsetup site-to-site

Initialize Interfaces 
	-Enable interfaces by #no shutdown
	-Choose trunk or Access Mode, create subinterfaces and apply vlan for trunking
	-Assign security levels 
	-Assing interfaces name
	-Assign IP addresses 
	-ASA do not support DTP(Dynamic Trunking protocol)
